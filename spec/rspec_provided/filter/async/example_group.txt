# no private methods in Opal, __memoized shows up here
ExampleGroup minimizes the number of methods that users could inadvertantly overwrite

# Invokes ExampleGroup#run directly, so of course it gets a promise back rather than false
ExampleGroup #before, after, and around hooks treats an error in before.* as a failure
ExampleGroup#run_examples returns false if any of the examples fail
ExampleGroup#run_examples runs all examples, regardless of any of them failing
