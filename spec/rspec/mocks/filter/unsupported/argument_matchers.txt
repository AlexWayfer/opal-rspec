# Fixnum == Float on Opal
argument matchers matching handling non-matcher arguments fails a class against an object of a different type
argument matchers matching instance_of handles non matching instances nicely
argument matchers matching instance_of does NOT accept float as instance_of\(Numeric\)
argument matchers matching instance_of does NOT accept fixnum as instance_of\(Numeric\)

# symbols and strings are different to this example but they are the same in Opal
argument matchers matching handling non-matcher arguments fails for a hash w/ wrong keys
