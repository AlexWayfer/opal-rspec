# probably due to an Opal bug in 0.8
RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher allows chainable methods to accept blocks

# something w/ inheritance is wrong here
RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher defined using the dsl can get a method object for methods in the running example

# probably class scoping issue since new_matcher creates a new DSL matcher class, probably https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/1110 related
RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher#match_unless_raises without a specified error class passes if no error is raised

# not sure, class scoping issue? (see above)
RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher#match_unless_raises with an unexpected error raises the error
RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher#match_unless_raises with an assertion with passing assertion passes
RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher with an included module allows multiple modules to be included at once
RSpec::Matchers::DSL::Matcher allows an early `return` to be used from a `match_unless_raises` block
