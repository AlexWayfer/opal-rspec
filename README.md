# opal-rspec

An attempt at a compatibility layer of rspec for opal.

## Usage

Add `opal-rspec` to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'opal-rspec'
```

### Run specs in phantomjs

To run specs, a rake task can be added which will load all spec files from
`spec/`:

```ruby
require 'opal/rspec/rake_task'
Opal::RSpec::RakeTask.new(:default)
```

Then, to run your specs inside phantomjs, just run the rake task:

```
bundle exec rake
```

### Run specs in a browser

`opal-rspec` can use sprockets to build and serve specs over a simple rack
server. Add the following to a `config.ru` file:

```ruby
require 'bundler'
Bundler.require

run Opal::Server.new { |s|
  s.main = 'opal/rspec/sprockets_runner'
  s.append_path 'spec'
  s.debug = false
}
```

Then run the rack server `bundle exec rackup` and visit `http://localhost:9292`
in any web browser.

## Contributing

Install required gems at required versions:

    $ bundle install

opal-rspec uses a prebuilt version of rspec to fix the areas where
opal cannot handle certain features of rspec. To build that file,
which is needed to run specs, use:

    $ bundle exec rake build

This should build `opal/opal/rspec/rspec.js` ready to use.

### Run on command line

A simple rake task should run the example specs in `spec/`:

    $ bundle exec rake

### Run in the browser

Run attached rack app to handle building:

    $ bundle exec rackup

Visit the page in any browser and view the console:

    $ open http://localhost:9292

## Things to fix

`opal/opal-rspec/fixes.rb` contains a few bug fixes that need to be merged upstream
to opal itself. `app/rspec-builder.rb` is used to precompile rspec ready to be used
in `opal-rspec`. All requires from `core.rb` have been inlined as opal cannot require
dynamically at runtime.
