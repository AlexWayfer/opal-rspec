OptionParser/stock runner:

RSpec::Core::Formatters::DocumentationFormatter produces the expected full output
RSpec::Core::Formatters::ProgressFormatter produces the expected full output

These use mocking (as_stubbed_const), which isn't working, might be easier to figure out in the mocks specs:

RSpec::Core::Formatters::Loader#add(formatter) when a legacy formatter is added with RSpec::LegacyFormatters loads formatters from the external gem
RSpec::Core::Formatters::Loader#add(formatter) when a legacy formatter is added with RSpec::LegacyFormatters subscribes the formatter to the notifications the adaptor implements

# This works right in Opal 0.9 (see ../subject_issue_test), might be something with the class scoping PR I did that requires compiler changes to fix
RSpec::Core::MemoizedHelpers explicit subject with a name yields the example in which it is eval'd

# This works right in Opal 0.9 (Class === Enumerable), might be https://github.com/opal/opal/commit/304ab9c464754ca54ab03f1f31d5c137ae8e995d but not sure
RSpec::Core::MemoizedHelpers implicit subject with a Module returns the Module

# https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/568 - long standing issue that hasn't been fixed
rspec warnings and deprecations #warn_with when :use_spec_location_as_call_site => true is passed adds the source location of spec
rspec warnings and deprecations #warn_with when :use_spec_location_as_call_site => true is passed appends a period to the supplied message if one is not present
rspec warnings and deprecations #warn_with when :use_spec_location_as_call_site => true is passed when there is no current example adds no message about the spec location

# splat problem? something isn't right here, same issue for the following 3
RSpec::Core::Metadata :description on a group with a non-string and a string concats the args
RSpec::Core::Metadata :full_description with a 2nd arg starting with # removes the space
RSpec::Core::Metadata :full_description with a 2nd arg starting with . removes the space
RSpec::Core::Metadata :full_description with a 2nd arg starting with :: removes the space
# end underlying

# similar issue for these 3 (splat/description)
RSpec::Core::FilterManager#exclusions#description includes an overriden :if filter
RSpec::Core::FilterManager#exclusions#description includes an overriden :unless filter
RSpec::Core::FilterManager#exclusions#description includes other filters
# end 2nd splat

RSpec::Core::Notifications::FailedExampleNotification uses the default color for the shared example backtrace line
